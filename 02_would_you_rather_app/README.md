# Would You Rather Project

This application allows users to play a "Would You Rather" game! This project is part of the Udacity React NanoDegree Program. The goal of this project is to build a React/Redux front-end app from scratch and to improve the predictability of the applicationâ€™s state using Redux. Establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

This project was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionalities

Before being able to use this application, users are prompted to log in. They can do so by selecting a user from a dropdown menu.
Once logged in, users can navigate between screens to perform actions. Currently there are 4 screens as described below.

## Screens

### Dashboard (Home Screen)

A list of all polls posted is displayed on the home screen. The user can toggle a button to see either the polls that has been answered or unanswered by himself.

### Poll Details

By clicking on vote on one specific poll from the home page, the user is able to vote provided that he has not done so before. There is 2 options for each poll.
Upon voting in a poll, information about how many people voted for one particular option is displayed along with the user's response.

### Submit new polling question

The user can submit a new question by entering 2 options. Once created, the new question will be automatically added on top of the unanswered questions of the dashboard.

### Leaderboard
