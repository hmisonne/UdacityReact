# Would You Rather Project

This project is part of the Udacity React NanoDegree Program. The goal of this project is to build a React/Redux front-end app from scratch to play a Would You Rather game.

This project has been bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this project should already have node installed on their local machines.

## About the stack

### Frontend Server

To run this app, on your terminal, cd to 02_would_you_rather_app :

install all project dependencies with `npm install`
start the development server with `npm start`
Open the localhost:3000 to view the App in development mode on the local server.

### Backend Server

Currently, there is no backend server setup. The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods to access the data.

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank Udacity for providing the framework and guidelines for this great project.
